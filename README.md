# Employee-Salary-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts whether an employee’s annual salary is greater than ₹50K or not using the Adult Income Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The model analyzes factors like education level, occupation, age, and working hours per week to make predictions.

🔍 Project Highlights
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handled missing values and encoded categorical data.

Machine Learning Model – Implemented Random Forest Classifier for accurate predictions.

Model Evaluation – Achieved high accuracy, generated a classification report, and analyzed feature importance.

Visualization – Created plots to show the most influential factors affecting salary.

🛠 Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

Jupyter Notebook / Python script

📊 Dataset
Adult Income Dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository

🚀 Future Scope
Integrate with HR dashboards for real-time predictions.

Implement advanced algorithms like XGBoost or Neural Networks.

Expand dataset for global applicability.
